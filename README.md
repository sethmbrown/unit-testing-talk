# Unit Testing

It's not as bad as you think, and sometimes it's worse

---

<!-- ### Difference between unit, integrated, and E2E testing -->

<!-- - Unit tests a single unit of logic -->
<!-- - Integrated tests a collection of units within a system -->
<!-- - E2E tests a user journey (for FE) or request flow (for API) -->
<!-- - In the real world, line is very blurry between these -->

<!-- ### Value of unit tests -->
<!-- - Prevent regressions (esp. when refactoring) -->
<!-- - Living documentation -->
<!-- - Can force more single responsibility, portable code, if you're lazy enough to let it -->

<!-- ### Common pitfalls of unit testing -->
<!-- - Like code, tests that try to do too much are doomed to fail -->
<!-- - Testing the wrong things -->
<!-- - Not embracing the fact that sometimes testing being a pain in the ass means your code is too complicated -->

<!-- ### When to pick which kind of testing -->
<!-- - If you have a good answer for this, lmk. Daily struggle -->
